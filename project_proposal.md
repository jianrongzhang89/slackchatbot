# Project Proposal: Slack Q&A MCP Bot

## 1. Project Overview

**Problem Statement**: Customer Support Team, New Users, and Developers are struggling to access timely information about products under development, bug support, and customer requests on Slack, leading to repeated requests, frustration, and productivity loss.

**Solution**: Build a centralized MCP (Model Context Protocol) application that provides intelligent Q&A capabilities by:
- Searching and citing existing Slack channel messages (prioritizing recent information)
- Suggesting external documentation when internal knowledge gaps exist
- Recommending subject matter experts based on chat history analysis
- Focusing on open "forum-" channels for privacy compliance

**Strategic Approach**: Phased implementation using Red Hat OpenShift to minimize initial investment while enabling enterprise-scale growth:
- **Phase 1**: MVP with $70/month infrastructure (4 weeks)
- **Phase 2+**: Scale based on proven value and user adoption
- **Year 1 Savings**: $34,300-36,590 (57-61% cost reduction)
- **Red Hat Ecosystem**: Fully integrated with existing infrastructure

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Core Components:
1. **MCP Server**: FastMCP-based application handling Q&A logic and protocol management
2. **Slack Integration Layer**: Slack Bolt SDK for bot API integration and message processing
3. **Message Database**: Indexed storage of forum channel messages with metadata
4. **Expert Discovery Engine**: Analysis system for identifying subject matter experts
5. **External Documentation Connector**: Integration with Red Hat source.redhat.com
6. **Analytics & Metrics Tracker**: Usage and success metrics collection

### MCP Server Implementation:

#### **FastMCP Framework** (Official Python MCP SDK)
- **Framework**: Anthropic's official FastMCP implementation
- **Protocol Handling**: Automatic MCP protocol compliance and message routing
- **Transport Support**: stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP for flexible deployment
- **Built-in Features**: Resource management, tool execution, prompt handling, and lifecycle management

#### **Server Architecture**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Slack Q&A Bot")

# Core Q&A functionality
@mcp.tool()
def search_slack_history(query: str, channel_filter: str = None) -> str:
    """Search Slack forum channels for relevant discussions"""
    # Search PostgreSQL database of indexed forum messages
    # Apply relevance ranking based on recency and quality
    return search_results_with_citations

@mcp.tool()
def find_subject_experts(topic: str, activity_threshold: int = 5) -> str:
    """Identify subject matter experts based on forum activity"""
    # Analyze user participation and reaction patterns
    # Return ranked list of experts with availability indicators
    return expert_recommendations

@mcp.resource("slack://forum/{channel_id}")
def get_channel_context(channel_id: str) -> str:
    """Retrieve recent context from specific forum channels"""
    # Fetch and format recent channel discussions
    return channel_summary

@mcp.tool()
def search_redhat_docs(query: str, doc_type: str = "all") -> str:
    """Search Red Hat source.redhat.com documentation"""
    # Interface with Red Hat documentation API
    # Return relevant documentation links and summaries
    return documentation_results

@mcp.prompt()
def generate_expert_introduction(expert_name: str, topic: str) -> str:
    """Generate contextual expert introduction for @mentions"""
    return f"@{expert_name}, we have a question about {topic} that matches your expertise..."
```

#### **Key Benefits for Our Implementation**
- **Rapid Development**: FastMCP abstracts protocol complexities, accelerating development
- **OpenShift Native**: Containerizes easily for OpenShift deployment
- **Slack Integration**: Clean separation between MCP logic and Slack Bolt SDK
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports horizontal scaling and multiple transport methods
- **Built-in Analytics**: Native support for logging, metrics, and monitoring
- **Context Management**: Sophisticated context handling for conversation continuity

#### **Development Workflow**
1. **Phase 1**: Basic FastMCP server with essential tools (search, experts, docs)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced resource management and caching strategies
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics tools and performance optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Machine learning integration and predictive capabilities

#### **Installation & Deployment**
```bash
# Install the official MCP SDK
pip install "mcp[cli]"

# Or with uv (recommended for faster package management)
uv add "mcp[cli]"

# Development and testing
uv run mcp dev slack_qa_server.py

# Production deployment on OpenShift
# The FastMCP server will be containerized and deployed as a pod
# with configurable transport (stdio/SSE/Streamable HTTP)
```

#### **FastMCP Server Benefits for OpenShift Deployment**
- **Container Ready**: FastMCP applications containerize seamlessly
- **Multiple Transports**: Supports stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP for different deployment scenarios

- **Backend**: Python with Slack Bolt SDK for Python
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with full-text search capabilities (OpenShift-hosted)
- **Message Processing**: Redis Queue + OpenShift Jobs (Phase 2+), In-memory queue (Phase 1)
- **Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search (Phase 1), Self-managed Elasticsearch (Phase 3+)
- **Analytics**: Built-in metrics collection with dashboard
- **Infrastructure**: Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA) + AWS managed services
- **Approach**: Phased implementation starting with MVP

### External Documentation Integration:
- **Primary Source**: https://source.redhat.com/
- **Integration Strategy**: Web scraping or API integration with Red Hat's internal documentation
- **Authentication**: Handle Red Hat SSO/authentication for source.redhat.com access
- **Fallback Behavior**: When Slack history lacks answers, search and suggest relevant source.redhat.com articles

# Connect to Redis (running in OpenShift)
redis_conn = redis.Redis(host='redis-service', port=6379, db=0)
queue = Queue('slack_processing', connection=redis_conn)

# Enqueue background tasks
def process_new_message(channel_id: str, message_data: dict):
    """Process new Slack message in background"""
    queue.enqueue(index_message_task, channel_id, message_data)

def update_expert_scores(user_id: str, activity_data: dict):
    """Update expert scoring in background"""
    queue.enqueue(expert_analysis_task, user_id, activity_data)
```

@app.task
def index_forum_message(message_data):
    """Background task to index Slack messages"""
    # Process and index message
    pass

@app.task
def analyze_expert_activity(user_data):
    """Background task to update expert scores"""

```python
# Simple in-memory processing for Phase 1
import asyncio
from asyncio import Queue

message_queue = Queue()

async def background_processor():
    """Simple background message processor"""
    while True:
        message = await message_queue.get()
        await process_message(message)
        message_queue.task_done()
```

#### **Phase 2: Redis Queue + OpenShift Jobs**
- **Implementation**: Redis-based queuing with OpenShift Jobs

kind: Job
metadata:
  name: slack-message-processor
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: processor
        image: slack-qa-processor:latest
        env:
        - name: REDIS_URL
          value: "redis://redis-service:6379"
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

#### **Phase 3: Celery + Redis (Hybrid)**
- **Implementation**: Celery for complex workflows, Redis for simple queuing
- **Cost**: $15/month
- **Rationale**: Best of both worlds - sophisticated task management with reliable queuing

#### **Phase 4: Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Implementation**: Full event streaming with Kafka or Redis Streams
- **Cost**: $30-50/month
- **Rationale**: Enterprise-grade event processing for advanced analytics
